This website is brought you using tools such as Jekyll, GitHub, Netlify
and the good work of the author, yours truly ðŸ¤“. Though I have been involved
in building websites for other companies, it is quite an undertaking working
on this one where all aspects of execution revolve around my own creativity,
no pressure right!

This is where it all started. I am not sure how I imagined this to go.
See I have been working on building software for the past 10 years.
I have worn many hats along the way. Now I am trying this blogging thing for size.
I will need your support for sure, I am not known to be a great writer.

I am embracing this challenge as I share with you all that I have learned
being in a tech industry and still learning. My goal is to help young developers
find their way as well.

To that end, I am introducing RVTR. It is part web experiment, part blog, documentation,
app portfolio. I will try to document technologies that matter to me and the
community I hope to foster. I have lots of ideas and I will be using this platform to
commnunicate, experiment, analyze and document.

In the coming months, I plan on introducing content around technologies I work with
daily or have interest in. You should expect articles around topics on .NET, Node.js and more.

Look around a little, I will be back with more shortly!
